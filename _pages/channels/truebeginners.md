A "No Judgement Zone" for newbies, a good place to get your feet wet and ask all kinds of questions as to where to start, or for clarification on things that may be confusing.

This channel is *usually* for less language-specific questions (eg: learning about classes vs. learning about C#), but feel free to ask here anyway.
